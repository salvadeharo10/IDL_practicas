2025-03-15 10:35:59,863 - launch.py - accelerate.commands.launch - WARNING - The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
	`--num_cpu_threads_per_process` was set to `2` to improve out-of-box performance when training on CPUs
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.
Some weights of BartForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/bart-large and are newly initialized: ['classification_head.dense.bias', 'classification_head.dense.weight', 'classification_head.out_proj.bias', 'classification_head.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Detected kernel version 3.10.0, which is below the recommended minimum of 5.5.0; this can cause the process to hang. It is recommended to upgrade the kernel to the minimum version or higher.

/opt/conda/lib/python3.12/site-packages/torch/autograd/graph.py:823: UserWarning: aten::layer_norm: an autograd kernel was not registered to the Autograd key(s) but we are trying to backprop through it. This may lead to silently incorrect behavior. This behavior is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of PyTorch. If your operator is differentiable, please ensure you have registered an autograd kernel to the correct Autograd key (e.g. DispatchKey::Autograd, DispatchKey::CompositeImplicitAutograd). If your operator is not differentiable, or to squash this warning and use the previous behavior, please register torch::CppFunction::makeFallthrough() to DispatchKey::Autograd. (Triggered internally at /pytorch/torch/csrc/autograd/autograd_not_implemented_fallback.cpp:62.)
