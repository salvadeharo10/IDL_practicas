2025-03-27 11:01:19,708 - launch.py - accelerate.commands.launch - WARNING - The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
	`--num_cpu_threads_per_process` was set to `2` to improve out-of-box performance when training on CPUs
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.
Some weights of MobileViTForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at apple/mobilevit-small and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- classifier.weight: found shape torch.Size([1000, 640]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([10, 640]) in the model instantiated
- classifier.bias: found shape torch.Size([1000]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([10]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
